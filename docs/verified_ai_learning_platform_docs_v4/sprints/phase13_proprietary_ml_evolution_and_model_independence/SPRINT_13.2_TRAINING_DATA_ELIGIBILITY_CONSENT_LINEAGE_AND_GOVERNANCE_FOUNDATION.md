# Sprint 13.2 — Training Data Eligibility Consent Lineage and Governance Foundation

## Sprint mission

Deliver the production-grade capability described by the title without weakening provider-neutrality, student privacy, verification truthfulness, or rollback safety.

## Conditional prerequisite

This sprint belongs to Phase 13. It may execute only after Phase 13 entry gates are documented as satisfied.

## Specific engineering outcomes

- Implement eligibility state model, purpose and policy versions.
- Connect retention/deletion/revocation semantics to dataset eligibility.
- Create privacy review and auditable decision workflow.

## Required canonical documents

- `ai/57_API_FIRST_HYBRID_AI_STRATEGY_AND_MODEL_EVOLUTION.md`
- `ai/58_PROPRIETARY_DATASET_GOVERNANCE_AND_TRAINING_ELIGIBILITY.md`
- `ai/59_SMALL_MODEL_FINE_TUNING_AND_SELF_HOSTING_READINESS.md`
- `ai/60_AI_UNIT_ECONOMICS_AND_INFERENCE_COST_ENGINEERING.md`
- `ai/61_MODEL_REGISTRY_RELEASE_AND_ROLLBACK_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `data/62_TRAINING_DATA_LINEAGE_CONSENT_AND_DATASET_PIPELINE.md`
- `quality/64_AI_MODEL_REPLACEMENT_DECISION_GATES.md`
- ADR-005, ADR-006, ADR-007.

## Hard invariants

- No training on ineligible production student content.
- No protected evaluation-set leakage.
- No model output can assign `VERIFIED`.
- No proprietary route may remove external fallback before an explicit future decision.
- Learner-domain contracts remain independent of ML framework/model choice.
- Model promotion must be reversible through configuration.

# Production Execution Specification v3 — Hybrid AI / Cost-Aware Revision

## Revision intent

This section upgrades the sprint from a task checklist into a production implementation contract aligned with the accepted API-first, progressively proprietary AI strategy. It is additive to the sprint's original scope; if any older text implies unconditional expensive model use or training-by-default, this revision takes precedence together with ADR-005/006/007.

## Phase-level engineering objective — Proprietary ML evolution

- Introduce proprietary models only after data, evaluation, economic and operational readiness gates.
- Start with bounded classifiers/predictors before specialized solving.
- Roll out through offline -> shadow -> canary -> production with immediate external fallback.

## Mandatory source-of-truth review before coding

At minimum, the implementer/agent must read:

- `00_MASTER_INDEX.md`
- `domain/10_DOMAIN_INVARIANTS_AND_BUSINESS_RULES.md`
- `quality/56_COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_REPOSITORY_FILE_HIERARCHY.md`
- `quality/41_ENGINEERING_STANDARDS_FOR_CODEX.md`
- `quality/42_DEFINITION_OF_DONE_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- `ai/57_API_FIRST_HYBRID_AI_STRATEGY_AND_MODEL_EVOLUTION.md`
- `ai/60_AI_UNIT_ECONOMICS_AND_INFERENCE_COST_ENGINEERING.md`
- ADR-005, ADR-006 and ADR-007 when AI/model/data economics are touched.

The sprint owner must additionally list the exact domain/API/data documents materially changed by this sprint in the PR description.

## Implementation decomposition requirement

Before writing production code, produce a short sprint-local implementation map containing:

1. owning bounded context/module;
2. domain states/invariants touched;
3. iOS screens/view-models/use cases touched;
4. backend commands/queries/policies/adapters touched;
5. database migrations/indexes touched;
6. API/event/schema changes;
7. AI capability/route implications;
8. privacy/security implications;
9. telemetry/SLO/cost implications;
10. test/evaluation evidence required;
11. rollout/feature-flag strategy;
12. rollback/recovery plan.

## Detailed workstreams

### AI / ModelOps
- Define capability, route policy version, input/output schema and provenance fields before implementation.
- Establish baseline quality/cost/latency numbers before changing routing or models.
- Add at least one failure/degraded case where the system refuses false certainty.
- Confirm whether secondary solving is required by risk policy or can be skipped.
- Document rollback configuration and evaluation dataset version.

### Data
- Define ownership, FK/constraint/index strategy, lifecycle and deletion semantics for every durable field.
- Use migrations and Testcontainers against PostgreSQL behavior; no H2-as-production proxy.
- Separate operational provenance from core learner semantics and avoid opaque JSON for relational business keys.

## AI economics / proprietary-model guardrail

For this sprint explicitly answer:

- Does this add or multiply an inference call?
- What is the expected invocation rate per learner action?
- Can deterministic code/cache remove the call?
- Can an economy-tier approved route satisfy the task?
- Is a secondary solver actually required, and what triggers it?
- What telemetry will reveal cost regression?
- Does this create data that might later be useful for training? If yes, it remains **not training eligible by default** and requires separate governed eligibility.

No sprint may introduce model training/self-hosted inference unless it belongs to the conditional proprietary-ML phase or an accepted ADR explicitly authorizes it.

## Production data contract checklist

If durable state changes:

- define canonical owner and source of truth;
- add migration with forward/backward operational plan;
- define FK/unique/check constraints where appropriate;
- define indexes from concrete access patterns;
- define retention/account-deletion behavior;
- define audit/provenance fields;
- ensure raw AI output is not persisted as authoritative domain state without validation;
- add fixture/contract updates for downstream consumers.

## API and concurrency contract checklist

If network/API behavior changes:

- validate request shape separately from domain rules;
- specify authentication, object authorization and entitlement;
- use idempotency for harmful duplicate mutation;
- define timeout/retry semantics;
- define async job state if response cannot complete in request budget;
- return stable machine-readable error codes;
- test duplicate/out-of-order/retry conditions;
- maintain backward compatibility or explicitly version the contract.

## Security/privacy abuse cases to test

At least evaluate:

- unauthorized object reference;
- malformed/oversized/adversarial input;
- retry or concurrency abuse;
- quota bypass;
- prompt injection where AI input is involved;
- private content appearing in logs/analytics;
- account deletion/retention omission;
- accidental training-data eligibility or dataset export.

## Observability and cost evidence

The sprint is not complete until a maintainer can diagnose it without reading raw student content. Add or verify:

- trace/correlation ID;
- success/failure/domain-outcome counters;
- p50/p95 latency where meaningful;
- retry/fallback/escalation counters;
- AI token/unit/cost attribution if AI is touched;
- cache hit/miss if caching is touched;
- alert or dashboard update for material operational risk.

## Test and evaluation matrix

Required as applicable:

| Layer | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Domain | unit tests for invariants/state transitions |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL/Testcontainers constraints and query behavior |
| API | contract + authz + stable error tests |
| iOS | ViewModel/use-case tests + critical UI/recovery path |
| AI | schema validation + golden dataset regression |
| Verification | deterministic/property-based tests for supported math |
| Security | abuse/object-authorization/secret/PII tests |
| Operations | failure injection or rollback demonstration |
| Economics | before/after expected invocation and cost impact when material |

## Rollout contract

For user-visible or model-sensitive behavior:

1. local/integration proof;
2. staging with production-like dependencies;
3. feature flag or route configuration;
4. internal/dogfood exposure;
5. canary if risk warrants;
6. observe product/quality/cost metrics;
7. progressive rollout;
8. documented rollback trigger.

## Expanded acceptance gate

- [ ] Implementation map exists and matches code ownership.
- [ ] Domain invariants remain server-authoritative.
- [ ] New AI calls have measured/estimated unit-cost impact.
- [ ] Secondary solver use is policy-driven rather than unconditional.
- [ ] New user data is not implicitly training eligible.
- [ ] Failure/degraded/retry path is implemented and tested.
- [ ] Observability supports diagnosis without sensitive-content logging.
- [ ] All relevant automated tests/evaluations pass.
- [ ] Feature flag/rollback exists when blast radius is material.
- [ ] Canonical docs were updated in the same change.
- [ ] No temporary dependency or folder violates the repository hierarchy.

## Required sprint evidence package

Attach or persist links/artifacts for:

- architecture/implementation map;
- migration/API/schema diff if any;
- test summary;
- AI evaluation report if any;
- cost/latency comparison if any;
- screenshots/demo for user-visible work;
- operational trace/metric example;
- rollout and rollback configuration;
- known limitations and follow-up issues.

## Codex execution rule

Codex must implement this sprint in small reviewable slices, re-reading the highest-precedence semantic documents before changing domain/API/data contracts. It must not “simplify” the architecture by moving rules into prompts, client code, provider SDK adapters, generic helpers, or ungoverned ML scripts.
